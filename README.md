# GoldPricePrediction
Conducted an extensive analysis of historical gold price data utilizing Python. Developed a predictive model employing a Random Forest Regressor for accurate gold price forecasts.
Project Title: Gold Price Prediction and Analysis

Tasks and Achievements:

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:
   - Loaded and explored the gold price dataset using pandas, while ensuring data integrity by checking for missing values.

2. Statistical Analysis:
   - Computed descriptive statistics to gain insights into the dataset's characteristics.

3. Correlation Analysis:
   - Investigated correlations between variables and visualized them using a heatmap for a comprehensive understanding.

4. Feature Selection and Data Preparation:
   - Identified and selected relevant features while separating them from the target variable to streamline the modeling process.

5. Data Splitting and Model Training:
   - Segmented the data into training and testing sets. Utilized a Random Forest Regressor with 100 estimators for model training.

6. Model Evaluation:
   - Predicted gold prices on the test set and assessed model performance using R-squared error as a key metric.

7. Result Visualization:
   - Presented a visual comparison of actual vs. predicted gold prices, providing a clear depiction of the model's effectiveness.

Conclusion:
Successfully executed an in-depth analysis of gold price data, employing a Random Forest Regressor to predict future gold prices. This project enhanced proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and financial forecasting.
